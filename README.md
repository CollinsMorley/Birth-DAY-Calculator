Birth-DAY-Calculator
====================

A JavaScript powered tool to determine the day of the week a person was born.

====================

Uses a single Javascript file (calendar.js) to show a series of inputs to allow the user to input their birth year and month, then displays a calendar for that month from which one could determine the day they were born.  In theory, this could also just be used as an on demand calendar.
